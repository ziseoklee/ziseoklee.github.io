										Poems
									</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I enjoy reading and writing poems. Finding the right words to encode insightful observations and deep interpretations in concise, rhythmical language is pure pleasure.
									Sometimes my inspiriations come from scientific observations of phenomena that, at first sight, seem completely irrelevant to our daily lives. 
									But from the interactions between an electron and a photon, to the gravity between neutron stars, there exists a consistent pattern.
									These patterns are, I believe, truths that apply even to human life and relationships.

									<h2>
										Christianity
									</h2>
									<p>
										An interactive, intimate, loving, nurturing, disciplined, committed relationship with God, since September 28th, 2022. 
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									I <b>acknowledge and accept</b> the bounds of my perception, intuition, and deduction. <br>
									Therefore, conscious or not, I inevitably live and act on faith. Faith is an <b>A priori assumption</b> on life and the after-life.<br>
									Is it true? The <b>proof</b> is to be derived from the incarnation of the attitude in my life. <br>
									I sense a strong similarity between faith in God and the methods we use to find solutions to dynamical systems. And our life is just that - an incredibly complex, multidimensional, entangled dynamical system.

									<h2>Five Qualities of Me</h2>
									<p>
										of which I am proud
									</p>
								</header>
								
								<ol>
									<li>
										I am <b>open to the truth</b> despite how painful it may be.<br>
										Curiosity outweighs the pain and struggle. I often design and implement experiments to answer my questions.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am <b>brave</b> in the sense that I am <b>willing to be bad</b> at something to get better at it. <br>
										The prospect of short-term failure and mistakes do not keep me from attempting to learn from them.
									</li>
									<li>
										I <b>do not give up</b> easily. <br>
											I believe problems do not just go away, so I work through them instead of avoiding them.
										</li>
									<li>
										I am <b>self-reflective</b>. <br>
										I reflect regularly to stay aware of my own emotions, vulnerabilities, beliefs, and presumptions.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am a <b>genuine</b> listener and conversationalist. <br>
										I am equipped with the appropriate language for deep communication and empathy. Try me.
									</li>
								</ol>

										<h2>Five Qualities of Me </h2>
										<p>
											of which I am <b>less</b> proud
										</p>
									</header>
									
								<ol>
									<li>
										I am susceptible to <b>shame</b>. <br>
										I suffer relatively high levels of shame and guilt even in situations that occur through no fault of my own.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am a <b>sore loser</b>. <br>
										I tend to get upset, frustrated, and self-critical when I lose. I need to fight this negative cycle when it occurs.
									</li>
									<li>
										I <b>do not let go</b> of what I do not understand (easily). <br>
										I need a long time to accept that some phenomena are just incomprehensible and move on with my life.
									</li>
									<li>
										I <b>struggle</b> to subject myself to a routine. <br>
										I wish I could wake up, work out, and go to the library at the same time like a habit, but it's always a struggle.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am <b>over-concerned</b> with certain things. <br>
										I find myself bothered by details, morality, hygiene, and achievement more than I want to be.
									</li>
