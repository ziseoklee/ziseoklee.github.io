						A lot of times, you are trying to learn something. <br>
						Maybe it's math, maybe it's programming, maybe it's computer science, or maybe it's physics. <br>
						(For me, it is learning to conduct independent research and write clear, easy-to-follow research papers.) <br>
						And you feel like you are never going to get it. <br>
						And the reality is, <b>once you get it, it's easy</b>. <br>
						It's like applying for work when you are looking for a job. You apply, and apply, and apply. You hear nothing. You get an interview and they say no. <br>
						All it takes is one yes. <br>
						Just like mathematics - all it takes is understanding <b>one thing</b>. <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						That's why you shouldn't give up when you are working on stuff. <br>
						Because you can never know how close you are. You never know. <br>
						You've had days in your life when everything is just going wrong. And one little thing happends and your day turns around. <br>
						You are closer than you think. <br>
						That's how life works. <br>
						Sometimes everything is really bad, and then one little thing can happen and it just changes everything for your day - or even your life - for the better. <br>
						You are closer than you think. <br>
						Don't give up.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a lot of people out there who are struggling with different things. <br>
						With math, with life, with relationships.	 <br>
						And  <b>if you give up, you won't succeed</b>. <br>
						It just comes down to that simple fact. <br>
						You cannot quit. <br>
						You can't quit. <br>
						You are closer than you think. <br>
						One of the hard things about this is that people don't <b>believe</b> that they are closer than they think. <br>
						People don't <b>believe</b> that they can succeed. <br>
						So you kind of have to have this blind <b>faith</b>. You have to <b>actually believe that you can do something that's impossible</b>. <br>
						And that takes some really strong inner strength, that you have inside you. You can do that. You can <b>choose to believe</b>. <br>
						But it's going to take some work.
