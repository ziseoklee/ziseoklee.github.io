						<li>If you're going to write, the first question is, "What is bugging you?". <b>Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.</b> Why do those things that bother you? You could be bothered by like a million things man, but some things grip you. They bug you and they might make you resentful and bitter because they bug you so much.</li>
						<li>If you ask yourself a real question, do you get an answer or not? The answer is: yes. <b>Thoughts start to appear in your head — from somewhere. Where those thoughts come from depends on your intent.</b> If your intent is to make things better, then maybe they come from the place designed to make things better. Maybe your intent is to make things worse. Then they come from hell. </li>
						<li>Neurologically, there's a production center and an editing center — and those can be separately affected by strokes. Often when people are writing or talking, they try to activate both at the same time — that's a big mistake. <b>Don’t try to write perfectly in the first draft; generate freely, edit later.</b></li>
						<li>Conscious and habitual — as you practice something consciously, it becomes habitual. A key learning mechanism in neuroscience: repetition converts deliberate action into automatic behavior via neuroplasticity.</li>
						<li>You want to be careful with your words but carefree — and the answer is: <b>orient yourself properly. You have to put yourself in the right receptive position with the right goal in mind — then you can trust what’s going to happen.</b> Clarity of intent and mental state affects cognition, creativity, and performance.</li>
						<li>It's gazing into the abyss that makes you better. Sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed towards the abyss and then you're traumatized. If it's involuntary and accidental it can kill you. And the terrible answer is, <b>yes to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily.</b></li>
						<li><b>The more voluntary the confrontation with hell, the more transformative it is.</b> If it’s involuntary, it’s traumatizing.</li>
						<li>Why should I have to subject myself to death in hell, I'm innocent? And then the answer to that is, <b>"even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed to the highest good"</b>. </li>
						<li>That's why the central Christian doctrine is pick up your cross and follow me. Not just in religious terms. Psychologically, <b>voluntary exposure to that which freezes and terrifies you in measured proportions is curative.</b></li>
						<li>Programming allows you to <b>create a thought experiment in action</b> — it can move, it can live, and you can ask questions of it." Treating code or models as dynamic, testable thoughts enables active learning and insight.</li>
