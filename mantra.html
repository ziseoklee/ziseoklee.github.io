									<h1>Mantra</h1>
								</header>
								<hr/>

								<header>
									<h2>There is always an alternative</h2>
									<p>You have the power to choose between what you want <b>now</b> and what you want <b>most</b></p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Grades <b>vs</b> Growth <br>
									Pride <b>vs</b> Humility <br>
									Complaining <b>vs</b> Volunteering <br>
									Avoidance <b>vs</b> Acceptance <br>
									Lemon <b>vs</b> Lemonade <br>
								</p>
								<p>
									You don't ride a rollercoaster for its destination. You ride it because you enjoy the journey. <br>
									Similarly, the goal of workout is not its completion, but to stimulate your muscles exactly where you want. <br>
									The goal of mathematics study is not to prove a particular theorem, but to stimulate your mind by forming connections between concepts to solve problems. <br>
									Same with writing assignments. Spending time researching different areas and learning is the point of assignments rather than completing the work quickly or getting good grades. <br>
									<br>
									You need to learn to think more than you need the grade. <br>
									i.e., you want <b>growth</b> more than you want <b>approval</b>.
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<header>
									<h2>He who sweats more in training will bleed less in war</h2>
									<p>Do you want to actually die, or let your simulations die so that you can live?</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Encourage yourself to take on challenging problems even if you end up making lots of mistakes. Mistakes are opportunities for brain growth.
									You don't learn by reading and listening, but by doing. Being bad at it is <b>just the first step</b> towards being good at it. 
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<header>
									<h2>An apple a day keeps the doctor away</h2>
									<p>Loving yourself requires the capacity to recognize that there is something about you that you need to work on</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Try not to fool yourself saying, “it is only 5 minutes a day”. 
									Get those 5 minutes optimized: prepare good food for breakfast, 
									improve your sleep quality and bedtime/morning routine, 
									smile to that person you see all the time, 
									and read, write, and listen to the truth every day. 
									If 5 minutes a day is so powerful, how much would you learn if you let yourself make mistakes and stumble for hours a day?
								</p>
								<p>
									You need moments when you realize that you do not have it all together and that you are not perfect. 
									If you deny that your behavior is inadequate and fail to seek ways to redeem yourself by learning from what you have done wrong,
									then you are also denying yourself the <b>opportunity for growth and self-love</b>.
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<header>
									<h2>Whatever You do, you do for the truth</h2>
									<p>2 Corinthians 13:8</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									You cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
									What you can do is challenge the truth and accept the truth: your limitations, mortality, and finitude. You have them regardless of whether you accept it.
									And when you do accept them, the idea of transcending them may give your suffering its meaning. 
									Accepting limitations means that you are constructing a better coordination of what you can do to overcome them. 
									Accepting limitations means that you accept that you will not reach perfection but can still do something to help yourself and those around you.
								</p>
								<p>
									Acceptance does not imply <b>reduction of work</b>; it implies reduction of unnecessary, disoriented, unfocused work. 
									You are saving yourself from wasting emotion, attention, time, and energy better pointed at self-expansion and growth. 
									The upside to knowing when you have failed is that you learn from it
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<header>
									<h2>Whom you spend your time with, there your heart will be also</h2>
									<p>Modified Version of Matthew 6:21</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									The point here is to remember to set aside time to spend getting to know yourself. (Because your heart should not be outside of your body)
									You might think, "aren't I always spending time with myself?". That depends on the definition of "with".
									You are the closest person to yourself in terms of physical distance, but there are other ways to define interpersonal distance.
								</p>
								<p>
									Consider <b>emotional distance</b>. Can you empathize with yourself? How well do you understand what you are going through? Does your lexicon include the right words and concepts you can use 
									to describe yourself? How well do you understand why you are taking action in life? How well do you understand your motives, what gives your life meaning,
									what you are willing to die for, and the essence of who you are? You need time to ask these questions, answer them, and listen to your own answers. 
								</p>
								<hr/>

								<header>
									<h2>Life is unpredictable (making it very experimentable)</h2>
									<p>Let go of the outcome and celebrate progress instead</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									You do not know whether things <b><em>will</em></b> go as planned, but neither do you know if they <b><em>should</em></b>. 
									You only know that you are constrained by the truth that you are not aware of. The truth you already know and have accepted no longer bothers you. 
									Think gravity. Is it so frustrating that you are stuck to the ground? The same goes for life's problems and responsibilities. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The <b>greatest good</b> the unknown might confer might be that which would allow us to transcend our innate limitations. 
									The <b>worst</b> the unkown could be is death, or lengthy suffering followed by death. The emotional set covered by the unknown is therefore very large,
									ranging from that which we desire most intently to that which we fear most. (Peterson, <em>Maps of Meaning</em>)
