                                            The ideal is a distraction<br>
                                            to the real<br><br>
                                            
                                            Depth is not trivial<br>
                                            It takes time to reveal<br><br>
                                            
                                            Each layer you peel<br>
                                            And the fruits they each yield<br>
                                            Are all real and <br>
                                            You know this because<br>
                                            It is what you feel<br><br>
                                            
                                            The deeper the foundation<br>
                                            The higher the building<br>
                                            But Immediate transformations<br>
                                            Are what ideals are instilling<br><br>
                                            
                                            It's not how life works<br>
                                            I understand why you whine<br>
                                            But good things take time<br>
                                            And one day you'll shine<br><br>
                                            
                                            You can have it for real<br>
                                            But first have the will<br>
                                            to release the distraction<br>
                                            - the distraction of your ideal            
                                        </p>

                                            <p>
                                                The poem was me telling myself not to sacrifice the real and present for some hypothetical future.
                                                And the “ideal” goal for me is depth: 
                                                Depth of understanding - in math and science and also in life, depth of trust, deep authentic relationships full of genuine interactions with another individual. 
                                                But I wanted to express that what is real is not an absolute value of depth (like math becomes real after you get a phd or a relationship is real only within a committed marriage) but the deepening of such aspects, getting to know a field of study or another individual better.
                                                And the ‘peeling each layer’ was my way of preserving the rhyme while conveying this idea.
                                                I felt that each layer I peel off is a fruitful, authentic process and although immediately I might not notice any differences, I feel that I have progressed and grown.

                                            One giant mountain stood erect upfront<br>
                                            Whose shadow darkened my path<br>
                                            Waves of exhaustion swept away passion<br>
                                            Leaving fear and inertia to confront<br><br>

                                            I took a step forward, but then I was lost<br>
                                            Before descending any deeper, I weighed its cost<br>
                                            This journey forward and upward<br>
                                            Could very well hurt me or worse - kill me<br><br>

                                            In the moment of overwhelming chaos, of collapse,<br>
                                            As I was succumbing to despair and hell,<br>
                                            Sun had reached the other side of the snowcap<br>
                                            Her shine had come with something to tell<br><br>

                                            "The mountain is not your tragedy but your triumph<br>
                                            The forest is your opportunity, not a nuisance<br>
                                            The shadow blinded you, but my shine found you<br>
                                            Now look above. You need only to aim at one star"<br><br>

                                            The Foolish traveler had not looked up<br>
                                            The guide is ever-present, high in the sky - a star<br>
                                            Toward that star, the traveler moved<br>
                                            At last, he saw green, ripe land, stretching afar<br>
                                        </p>
