											<h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
											<p>Robert Frost</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
											And sorry I could not travel both<br>
											And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
											And looked down one as far as I could<br>
											To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>

											Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
											And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
											Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
											Though as for that the passing there<br>
											Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>

											And both that morning equally lay<br>
											In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
											Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
											Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
											I doubted if I should every come back.<br><br>

											I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
											Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
											Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br>
											I took the one less traveled by,<br>
											And that has made all the difference.

											Best of any song<br>

                                            The ideal is a distraction<br>
                                            to the real<br><br>
                                            
                                            Depth is not trivial<br>
                                            It takes time to reveal<br><br>
                                            
                                            Each layer you peel<br>
                                            And the fruits they each yield<br>
                                            Are all real and <br>
                                            You know this because<br>
                                            It is what you feel<br><br>
                                            
                                            The deeper the foundation<br>
                                            The higher the building<br>
                                            But Immediate transformations<br>
                                            Are what ideals are instilling<br><br>
                                            
                                            It's not how life works<br>
                                            I understand why you whine<br>
                                            But good things take time<br>
                                            And one day you'll shine<br><br>
                                            
                                            You can have it for real<br>
                                            But first have the will<br>
                                            to release the distraction<br>
                                            - the distraction of your ideal            
                                        </p>

											The poem was me telling myself not to sacrifice the real and present for some hypothetical future.
											<br>And the “ideal” goal for me is depth: 
											Depth of understanding - in math and science and also in life, depth of trust, deep authentic relationships full of genuine interactions with another individual. 
											<br>But I wanted to express that what is real is not an absolute value of depth (like math becomes real after you get a phd or a relationship is real only within a committed marriage) but the deepening of such aspects, getting to know a field of study or another individual better.
											<br>And the ‘peeling each layer’ was my way of preserving the rhyme while conveying this idea.
											I felt that each layer I peel off is a fruitful, authentic process and although immediately I might not notice any differences, I feel that I have progressed and grown.

											One giant mountain stood erect upfront<br>
											Whose shadow darkened my path<br>
											A wave of exhaustion swept away passion<br>
											Leaving fear and inertia to confront<br><br>
											
											Cliffs were conquered, ridges defeated<br>
											But I was nowhere near the top<br>
											My steps "forward" had taken me deeper,<br>
											Only, I felt more alone and lost<br><br>
											
											Funny thing about depth - how it gnaws at the soul<br>
											There's no forward; just getting out of the hole<br>
											What now, could I do, but wonder how<br>
											I got myself stuck in this rut<br><br>
											
											Self revealed itself a weak, stupid, lazy coward<br>
											An incompetent, useless fool<br>
											Nothing - not even my voice - was on my side<br>
											And I had taken every step to deserve it<br><br>

											Cold, bitter, and angry, I allowed no tears<br>
											But a sudden warmth emerged from behind<br>
											Why did she hug me? I had done nothing right<br>
											Still, Sun and her shine was on my side<br>
											
											In her I saw the mountain but no tragedy<br>
											I saw an adventure awaiting me<br>
											Inside the menacing forest I saw my teacher<br>
											And within myself the brave student<br><br>

											One giant mountain stood erect upfront<br>
											And I - I was saved by a yellow light<br>
                                        </p>

											You are the Photon to my Electron. This is a poem I wrote thinking about what Yena's presence in my life during the last few semesters meant to me. However, it is not exclusively about her nor restricted to her only.
