										Good Morning, Lord! Thank you for the <b>gift</b> of a new day. I offer this day to you. <br>
										We work but we know that it is not our work that gives us what we have. <br>
										What we have is by the <b>grace</b> of God. <br>

									<h2>MORNING PRAYER</h2>
									<p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp-XfPtsReI&t=1485s&ab_channel=DonMoenTV">I Offer My Life</a></p>
								</header>
								<p>
									To <b>God</b> who fills my heart with immeasurable joy, good morning.<br>
									Hereâ€™s to another day filled with love and happiness!<br>
									Lord, what would you have me to do today? My life is yours. My time is yours. <br>
									I offer you my life. Guide me today, Lord. I wish to do the things that you desire for me to do. 
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"The rule of prayer precedes the rule of faith." <br>
									The deeper truth is that <b>if</b> one prays a lot, then, <b>and only then</b>, 
									will one be likely to grow in faith. To pray is to change.

								<blockquote>
									The varieties of idolatry are "Legion": money, sex, novelty, political power, security, possessions, and on and on. All are false gods.
									True glory is ours only insofar as we <b>submit</b> ourselves to the true God. <br>

									<h2>THE DECISION</h2>
									<p>If I have to fall <b>2000 times</b> to learn to stand, I will get back up <b>2001 times</b> and more.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									The fundamental choice is, <b>am I on my side?</b><br>
									Am I on the side of legitimate struggle? Of acceptance, truth, reality, honesty, effort, vulnerability, growth, trasncendence, healing, triumph, empathy, attention, faith, commitment, grace, gratitude, regulation, forgiveness, love, peace, generosity, humility, and courage? <br>
									It seems like the only other option is the path of insecurity, cowardice, ignorance, naivety, neediness, greed, deception, ungratefulness, victimization, defensiveness, condemnation, shame, guilt, judgement, reduction, and compartmentalization.
								</p>
								<p>
									Good things take time. Great successes are built on even greater failures with the addition of the courage and wisdom to continue.
									<b>Early successes</b> have a framing effect; it limits one's growth in the long run and creates dishonesty and a fear of failure.
									The right way to think about success is that <b>the outcome is not the purpose, but a mere corollary of having fun and working my hardest to become my best</b>.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 
									Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.<br>
									<b>Matthew 6:33-34</b>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									<b>THE FOOL PRECEDES THE MASTER</b> In particular, neuroplasticity and muscle plasticity is the ability of the brain or muscle to alter its structural and functional properties in accordance with the environmental conditions imposed on it. 
									The brain growth and muscle growth come from the experience of struggle. Research has recently shown something stunning-when students make a mistake in math, their brain grows, synapses fire, and connections are made; when they do the work correctly, there is no brain growth (Moser ret al. 2011)
								</p>
								<p>
									We should not view mistakes as learning failures, but as learning achievements. (Boaler 2013). Being outside our comfort zone is an extremely important place to be.

									<h2>REMEMBER</h2>
									<p>Empty the mind, stay open to everything. I am a baby bamboo.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> my natural tendency to forget, repeat mistakes, and ignore God. 
									I am a spiritual baby, forever dependent on the nurturing, loving, transforming force of God.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> loving myself requires the <b>capacity to recognize</b> that there is something about me
									 that I need to work on. Loving others requires the capacity to recognize what the other person needs to work on.
								</p>
								<p>
									We need moments when we realize that we do not have it all together and that we are not perfect. 
									If we deny that our behavior is inadequate and fail to seek ways to redeem ourselves by 
									learning from what we have done wrong, 
									then we are also denying ourself the opportunity for growth and self-love.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> how grateful I was to meet my limitations during my workout at ExtremeS. 
									I couldn't do the back-pull exercise lying down, so I did it like the female exercisers - leaning diagonally. 
									But it was still hard. The experience of meeting my limitations is unpleasant at first, but it gives me a purpose, direction, and it propells me to change. To live.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknessess, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>
									<b>2 Corinthians 12:10</b>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> that strength comes not from words, but from the experience of adversity and tragedies that I overcame. When times get hard, the truth comes out. 
									Adversities reveal to me my own limitations, but also my own strengths. Problems and pains are what nurture competence and tolerance.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> what I did. In my darkest, most miserable moments, I know what I did instead of giving up. 
									I had nobody anyway. There was no team. I built, tried again, and aimed up even when I had nothing and no one.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity.<br>
									<b>Proverbs 11:3</b>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> that in my finest moments, I did not care so much about approval or results. I was focused on having fun and learning as much as I can.
									These moments are not necessarily the finest moments in other people's eyes.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>REMEMBER</b> that confidence and authenticity come from conquering the demons of myself. People love to lie about who they are not. I might be lying to myself about who I am.
									Authenticity is polarizing, but that also means that those who like you like <b>you</b>. 
									The alternative is self-deceptive superficial expediency, which invokes anxiety, insecurity, and hunger for approval.

									<h2>EMOTION</h2>
									<p>A glimpse into the wonders of the unconscious mind: Emotion is not a lower function localized in an ancestral primitive brain. It is a large-scale network property of the nervous system.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>Spend more time</b> with the people you care about. Friends and family.
									<br> We naturally take relationships for granted. Like regular workouts or study sessions, the people who made it a practice to stay connected to people they care about regularly were the ones who stayed connected and happy.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Age 80 respondents</b>, when asked, "<b>What are you most proud of?</b>" They all answered, "<b>A good relationship</b>" (nobody mentioned achievement)<br>
									When asked about their <b>biggest regret</b>, they answered, "I wish I had spent more time with people I care about."
								</p>
								<p>
									The best emotional strategy is the strategy of <b>emotional awareness</b>. 
									If I know myself better than any other person, I am less prone to being affected or hurt by others' response to my thoughts, motives, or emotions.
									<b>Discern the validity of the emotion</b> - whether or not the emotion is based on a delusion. If it is, expressing the emotion will cause confusion and creep out the other person.
								</p>
								<p>
									Everyone goes through suffering and tragedy, stress and fear. They are not an indicator of a bad life nor a good life. A measure of wellness of life might be <b>quality of relationships</b>, or more fundamentally, <b>a life lived to its full potential</b>
									given all the tragedies and obstacles and gifts and opportunities. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>I have the power to give my life its meaning</b> by maintaining integrity, responsibility, honesty, discipline, and by aiming at God (even in ways that seem embarrassingly trivial) despite all the reasons not to. 
									I can choose the meaning of my suffering instead of passively conforming to societal standards.
								</p>

								<hr>
								<header id="action">
									<h2>GET UP!</h2>
									<p>You don't get less afraid; You make yourself braver and stronger!</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>Reduce</b> the task until I am willing to do it. For starters, get out of bed and make my bed. I believe that once I take the first small step forward in the right direction, something in me will respond. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Don't</b> take pride in who I am. That's a bad idea. Take pride in <b>whom I am becoming</b>. <b>Celebrate progress</b>. 
									No matter how small the baby steps are, if I am progressing, that is infinitely better than staying where I am.
									That's the difference between living and dying. I can let things go when I know there's more growth to come.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have a primal covenant, moral obligation, commitment, responsibility to the community of my 
									iterated selves accross time. I realize reading through my self-kakaotalks that I am my own community. 
									There is much more to me than I thought. I can learn from my past selves and <b>act in the present</b> to help my future selves.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>An apple a day matters most.</b> As much as the brain can grow, it can shrink. 
									That's neuroplasticity. Consistency consolidates. The Anterior Mid-cingulate cortex grows when I continue doing what I don't like to do. 
									My will gets stronger the harder I do things that suck.
								</p>
								<p>
									I need to be <b>vulnerable</b> with myself to change. 
									As Carl Jung writes, "Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart." 
									I need to look into my heart and acknowledge what needs to be attended to. 
									"Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes." <b>Wake up!</b> 
									There is a part of me that needs my work and attention; my love.
								</p>

									We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.<br>
