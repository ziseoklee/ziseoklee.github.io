# My Playground 

This is Zi-Seok's Playground, a text-heavy, article-oriented website built around a huge background. The main motive for developing this site was for playful purposes as the name supposes. However, anything I have uploaded or written on the site is genuine and true (I can confirm if you contact me), allowing the site to function as my online profile/resume as well.
