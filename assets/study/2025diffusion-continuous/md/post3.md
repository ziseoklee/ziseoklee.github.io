# Part III: Stochastic Interpolant

[← Back to contents](index.html)

* Flow matching, conditional flow matching, bregman divergence, proof of conditional flow matching loss = flow matching loss in terms of optimization problem
* Fokker Planck equation vs. Continuity equation
* Flow Matching Guide and Code <- content from this book
* Stochastic Interpolants <- theorems and proofs from this book, likelihood control of Fokker planck equations vs transport equations etc
* Unified formulation of diffusion and flow under the interpolant framework
