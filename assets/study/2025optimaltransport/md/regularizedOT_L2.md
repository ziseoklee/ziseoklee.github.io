# L2 Regularized Optimal Transport

[← Back to contents](index.html)

L2 regularized Optimal Transport, also known as quadratically regularized Optimal Transport, offers distinct properties by penalizing the squared norm of the transport plan or related flow variables. While it is less commonly discussed in the context of general machine learning applications compared to its entropic counterpart, it holds specific advantages for certain problem structures.
