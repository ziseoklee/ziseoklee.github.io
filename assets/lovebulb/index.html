					<h1>The Lovebulb</h1>
					<p>A working metaphor I am exploring as I begin my research journey</p>
				</div>
				
				<hr>
				
				<div>
					<blockquote>
						The <b>lovebulb</b> is a lightbulb with a heart-shaped filament.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						At the beginning of my research journey, I wanted a symbol that could carry both intellectual weight and 
						emotional resonance — something that could embody the interplay of thought, creativity, and devotion that 
						I believe drives the pursuit of knowledge. To this end, I created the lovebulb: a lightbulb with a 
						heart-shaped filament. 
					</p>
					<h3>Lightbulb, the Modern Candle</h3>
					<p>
						Before the lightbulb, there was the candle. In many cultures and religious traditions, lighting a candle is 
						more than a practical act; it is ritual, symbol, and prayer. A candle transforms wax into flame, flame into 
						light — a process of material being consumed so that illumination and warmth may be born. This act embodies 
						transformation, sacrifice, and hope: the small but steady light that persists against darkness.
					</p>
					<p>
						When humanity invented the lightbulb, we created not only a more efficient source of light, but also a new 
						symbol layered upon the old. The lightbulb became the emblem of invention itself, of the sudden idea that 
						brightens the mind in a flash of insight. We speak of a “lightbulb moment” to describe discovery, clarity,
						 the spark of possibility. When I first decided to pursue this field of research, it was this lightbulb 
						 moment that captured my heart — the thrill of illumination, the promise that careful inquiry could pierce 
						 uncertainty. The lightbulb is thus not only a modern candle, but also a monument to human ingenuity, 
						 engineering, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
					</p>

					<h3>Love, the Electric Potential</h3>
					<p>
						Yet invention alone is not enough to sustain research. The more I reflect on what drives discovery, 
						the more I return to a deeper source: love. It is extraordinarily difficult to solve problems that have 
						never been solved before. Data, algorithms, and models can only go so far; at the heart of it all is the 
						<b>human act of creation</b>. Humans teach other humans. Humans teach AI. The data that fuels artificial intelligence 
						is itself a record of human creativity, labor, and imagination. Intelligence — whether biological or artificial 
						— is not generated in a vacuum; it is embedded within the long history of human effort, culture, and care.
					</p>
					<p>
						What, then, powers the creation of new things? Behind every solution lies a generative force, and again and again 
						I find that force to be love. Sexual love creates life. Parental love nurtures growth. Artistic love fashions 
						beauty. Intellectual love builds ideas. Ethical love sustains community. Creation in all its forms is born out 
						of attachment, devotion, and care. Love is the potential that makes creation possible, the invisible voltage that 
						drives current through the circuit of human striving. It is love that allows us to persist in the face of resistance, 
						to endure frustration and delay, to carry responsibility. Without love, perseverance collapses into exhaustion; 
						with love, perseverance becomes luminous.
					</p>

					<h3>Lovebulb, the Interplay of Intellect and Emotion</h3>
					<p>
						Here is where the metaphor comes together: how does a lightbulb shine? Through incandescence. As electrical 
						current flows through a filament, resistance heats it until it glows, emitting light. Resistance is not a 
						hindrance but the necessary condition for illumination.
					</p>
					<p>
						So too in research, in art, in life. Love is the electric potential that drives the current; intellect is the 
						filament that gives it form. Resistance — the difficulty of problems, the weight of responsibility, the 
						temptation to quit — is not merely an obstacle. It is the very process by which the filament glows. The filament 
						does not shine despite resistance, but because of it. Love enables this transformation: the invisible potential 
						becomes visible radiance, the hidden devotion becomes light in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus, the lovebulb symbolizes the union of intellect and emotion, logic and creativity, discipline and passion. 
						It reminds me that the act of research is not only technical problem-solving but also a profoundly human endeavor, 
						sustained by devotion to truth, to beauty, and to the communities we serve. If the candle once invited light into 
						human ritual and prayer, the lightbulb invites light into human invention and discovery. The lovebulb — my personal 
						emblem — reminds me that behind every idea, every act of creation, is a flame: 
						the incandescent power of love.

					<h4>1. Lightbulb, the Modern Candle</h4>
					<p>
						Before the lightbulb, humans lit candles. In many cultures and religions, lighting a candle is a sacred ritual 
						that invokes spiritual connection and symbolizes the presence of the Divine. 
						The act of lighting a candle holds multiple meanings: <b>Transformation</b> (the flame turning wax into light and warmth), 
						<b>Illumination</b> (lighting up darkness), <b>Hope</b> (a small but persistent light in times of difficulty), 
						<b>Sacrifice</b> (the candle burning away).
					</p>
					<p>
						A lightbulb is a modern candle with an additional layer of meaning: <b>Innovation and Engineering</b>. 
						The lightbulb is a universal symbol of ideas, invention, and brilliance. 
						Inquiry and research are often associated with a lightbulb moment, where a sudden insight or understanding 
						illuminates a previously dark or unclear area of knowledge. This moment of clarity is often accompanied by a sense of excitement and possibility, which I fell in love with when I decided to pursue a degree in this field.
					</p>
					<h4>2. Love, the Electric Potential</h4>
					<p>
						It is very difficult to solve problems, especially problems that have not been solved before. 
						As a researcher in artificial intelligence, I constantly wonder about the fundamental nature of intelligence and what drives the creation of new ideas and solutions. 
						Most generative learning algorithms are data-driven, and the data is generated, collected, and filtered by humans! 
						Humans teach other humans and humans teach AI. AI is interwoven with the entire past and present of human creativity and experience, 
						and I don't think there is a simple answer to what enables intelligence to generate new things.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solutions require <b>creation</b>. For example, for the solution to the problem of the survival of a species, that species creates offspring, tools, and communities.
						Behind every creation is <b>love</b>. Sexual love creates life; parental love nurtures growth; intellectual love creates ideas; artistic love creates beauty; ethical love creates community. 
						Hence, <b>love</b> seems to be the driving force behind <b>creation</b>, enabling the discipline and perseverance required to confront and solve <b>problems</b>.
					</p>
					<h4>3. Lovebulb, the Interplay of Intellect and Emotion</h4>
					<p> 
						Think about how does a lightbulb lights: <b>Incandescence</b>. As electricity <b>flows</b> through a filament, it heats up due to <b>electrical resistance</b> and begins to emit electromagnetic radiation.
						Likewise, <b>Love</b> is the electric potential that drives current through the filament.
						Love enables perseverance through emotional resistance - pain, temptations to lie, responsibility, and delayed gratification. 
						Love transforms the cold, dark filament into something radiant. Resistance is not an obstacle, but a necessary condition for the filament to emit light. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In all domains, the generative act requires both passion and persistence through resistance — the filament glowing not despite resistance, but because of it.
						Therefore, the lovebulb is a metaphor for the interplay of intellect and emotion, logic and creativity, discipline and passion.
						When we light a candle, we invite light into our lives, both literally and metaphorically. A modern candle is a lightbulb, and the lovebulb is a symbol of this light.
						It serves as a personal reminder of all these symbolic meanings and values.
