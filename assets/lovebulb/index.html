					<h1>The Lovebulb</h1>
					<p>A working metaphor I am exploring as I begin my research journey</p>
				</div>
				
				<hr>

				<div class = "dropdown">
					<blockquote class ="dropdown-header">
						The <b>lovebulb</b> is a lightbulb with a heart-shaped filament.
					</blockquote>
					<div class="dropdown-content">
						<p>
							At the beginning of my research journey, I wanted a symbol that could carry both intellectual weight and 
							emotional resonance — something that could embody the interplay of thought, creativity, and devotion that 
							I believe drives the pursuit of knowledge. To this end, I created the lovebulb: a lightbulb with a 
							heart-shaped filament. 
						</p>

						<h3>Lightbulb, the Modern Candle</h3>
						<p>
							Before the lightbulb, there was the candle. In many cultures and religious traditions, lighting a candle is 
							more than a practical act; it is ritual, symbol, and prayer. A candle transforms wax into flame, flame into 
							light — a process of material being consumed so that illumination and warmth may be born. This act embodies 
							transformation, sacrifice, and hope: the small but steady light that persists against darkness.
						</p>
						<p>
							When humanity invented the lightbulb, we created not only a more efficient source of light, but also a new 
							symbol layered upon the old. The lightbulb became the emblem of invention itself, of the sudden idea that 
							brightens the mind in a flash of insight. We speak of a “lightbulb moment” to describe discovery, clarity,
							the spark of possibility. When I first decided to pursue this field of research, it was this lightbulb 
							moment that captured my heart — the thrill of illumination, the promise that careful inquiry could pierce 
							uncertainty. The lightbulb is thus not only a modern candle, but also a monument to human ingenuity, 
							engineering, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
						</p>

						<h3>Love, the Electric Potential</h3>
						<p>
							Yet invention alone is not enough to sustain research. The more I reflect on what drives discovery, 
							the more I return to a deeper source: love. It is extraordinarily difficult to solve problems that have 
							never been solved before. Data, algorithms, and models can only go so far; at the heart of it all is the 
							<b>human act of creation</b>. Humans teach other humans. Humans teach AI. The data that fuels artificial intelligence 
							is itself a record of human creativity, labor, and imagination. Intelligence — whether biological or artificial 
							— is not generated in a vacuum; it is embedded within the long history of human effort, culture, and care.
						</p>
						<p>
							What, then, powers the creation of new things? Behind every solution lies a generative force, and again and again 
							I find that force to be love. Sexual love creates life. Parental love nurtures growth. Artistic love fashions 
							beauty. Intellectual love builds ideas. Ethical love sustains community. Creation in all its forms is born out 
							of attachment, devotion, and care. Love is the potential that makes creation possible, the invisible voltage that 
							drives current through the circuit of human striving. It is love that allows us to persist in the face of resistance, 
							to endure frustration and delay, to carry responsibility. Without love, perseverance collapses into exhaustion; 
							with love, perseverance becomes luminous.
						</p>

						<h3>Lovebulb, the Interplay of Intellect and Emotion</h3>
						<p>
							Here is where the metaphor comes together: how does a lightbulb shine? Through incandescence. As electrical 
							current flows through a filament, resistance heats it until it glows, emitting light. Resistance is not a 
							hindrance but the necessary condition for illumination.
						</p>
						<p>
							So too in research, in art, in life. Love is the electric potential that drives the current; intellect is the 
							filament that gives it form. Resistance — the difficulty of problems, the weight of responsibility, the 
							temptation to quit — is not merely an obstacle. It is the very process by which the filament glows. The filament 
							does not shine despite resistance, but because of it. Love enables this transformation: the invisible potential 
							becomes visible radiance, the hidden devotion becomes light in the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thus, the lovebulb symbolizes the union of intellect and emotion, logic and creativity, discipline and passion. 
							It reminds me that the act of research is not only technical problem-solving but also a profoundly human endeavor, 
							sustained by devotion to truth, to beauty, and to the communities we serve. If the candle once invited light into 
							human ritual and prayer, the lightbulb invites light into human invention and discovery. The lovebulb — my personal 
							emblem — reminds me that behind every idea, every act of creation, is a flame: 
							the incandescent power of love.

						For though the righteous fall seven times, they <b>rise</b> again. <br>
						Proverbs 24:16

						<blockquote>
							Success is not final, failure is not fatal:
							it is the <b>courage to continue</b> that counts. <br>
							- Winston Churchill
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							Human potential at its best is to transform a tragedy into a personal triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. <br>
							― Viktor Frankl
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation—just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer—we are challenged to change ourselves. <br>
							― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning
						</blockquote>
						
						<blockquote>
							Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.<br>
							- Carol Dweck, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							The mindsets change what people strive for and what they see as success. When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world — the world of fixed traits — success is about proving you’re smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other — the world of changing qualities — it’s about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself.
							In one world, failure is about having a setback. Getting rejected. In the other world, failure is about not growing. Not reaching for the things you value. It means you’re not fulfilling your potential.
							In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means you’re not smart or talented. If you were, you wouldn’t need effort. In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented. <br>
							- Carol Dweck, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
