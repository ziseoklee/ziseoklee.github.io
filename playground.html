									<h2>Five Qualities of Me</h2>
									<p>
										of which I am Proud
									</p>
								</header>
								
								<ol>
									<li>
										I am <b>open to the truth</b> despite how painful it may be.<br>
										Curiosity outweighs the pain and struggle. I often design and implement experiments to answer my questions.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am <b>brave</b> in the sense that I am <b>willing to be bad</b> at something to get better at it. <br>
										The prospect of short-term failure and mistakes do not keep me from attempting to learn from them.
									</li>
									<li>
										I <b>do not give up</b> easily. <br>
											I believe problems do not just go away, so I work through them instead of avoiding them.
										</li>
									<li>
										I am very <b>self-reflective</b>. <br>
										I reflect consistently to stay aware of my own emotions, vulnerabilities, beliefs, and presumptions.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am a <b>genuine</b> listener and conversationalist. <br>
										I am equipped with the appropriate language for deep communication and empathy. Try me.
									</li>

										<h2>Five Qualities of Me </h2>
										<p>
											of which I am <b>not</b> Proud
										</p>
									</header>
									
								<ol>
									<li>
										I am susceptible to <b>shame, self-disgust, and self-contempt</b>. <br>
										I suffer very high levels of shame and guilt even in situations that occur through no fault of my own.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am a <b>sore loser</b>. <br>
										I get very upset, frustrated, and self-critical very easily. I need to fight this negative cycle when it occurs.
									</li>
									<li>
										I <b>do not let go</b> easily. <br>
										I need a long time to accept that some phenomena are just incomprehensible and move on with my life.
									</li>
									<li>
										I <b>struggle</b> with self-discipline. <br>
										I wish I could wake up, work out, and go to the library at the same time like a habit, but it's always a struggle.
									</li>
									<li>
										I am <b>over-concerned</b> with certain things. <br>
										I find myself bothered by details, morality, hygiene, and achievement way more than I should be.
									</li>
